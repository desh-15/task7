WHAT I DID:
1.loaded the breast cancer dataset and cleaned it up  
2.used two features and scaled them for better performance  
3.trained SVM models with both linear and RBF kernels  
4.visualized the decision boundaries for both models  
5.tuned hyperparameters and used cross-validation to check performance
